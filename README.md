**Level 3:**
Fill in the Blank and the Dots

*Solution:* Good/Dead

When user selects Cristiano Ronaldo as my favourite football player which is correct as I follow only him on my socials, user gets a morse code to decode, which is 'Good'. After entering 'Good', user passes to next level.

But when user selects other footballers as my favourite, they get 'dead' coded morse code. After successfully decoding that, it leads to a Deadend! After which, user has to start this level all over again.

*Soft skills assessed:*

Eye for Detailing, Knowledge and Intelligence are softskills required to be able to sense that line and dot to be a morse code and decode it.

**Level 4:**
Cracking GenZ Lingo

*Solution:* MARVEL

In GenZ lingo, english phrases doesn't have their conventional meaning, rather they have unpredictable mapping to the phrases. Just like 'lie' is mapped to 'cap'. So, the answer now becomes,
Combination of all Caps (Capital Letters) from that sentense- MARVEL

*Soft skills assessed:*

Perseverense, Perspective, and Knowledge are required to be able to sense that GenZ mapping.

Creativity can be assessed as the user has to crack the lingo.

Here, the puzzle diverges again and prompts user to choose a MARVEL character(Ironman or Spiderman) to fight for themselves.

**Level 5:**
The MKBHD Shoe

*Solution:* M122

If user selects Ironman, after entering the correct solution, Ironman will be dead (as in the movie) hinting that this is the deadend. And for the user to proceed, they have to select spiderman as he lives in the movie.

The answer is the name of shoe I would name if I would release just like MKBHD did. His shoe was named M251 which stands for Model 251. He named it 251 because, his first ever youtube video length was 2:55 minutes long. And my first video is 1:22 minutes long.

*Soft skills assessed:*

Curiosity, Perseverense, and Eye for detailing are required to be able to realise the reason behind naming of 251!

Analytical Thinking and Intelligence are required to crack the code and come up with the name of my shoe

**Level 6:**
User must enter the correct 6-letter code

*Solution:* 20022b

The text that has given as hint says that 'background score tells alot about foreground', which is hinting that background has alot to do with the answer. 6-letter code and that # before form input makes it guessable that the answer is actually, the hex color code of background

*Soft skills assessed:*

Creativity, Intelligence, and Analytical Thinking are the skills required to come up with the thought that it is the color code of background.

Curiosity and Knowledge are assessed here. They need to know that hex code of color is the answer.
